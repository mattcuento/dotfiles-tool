# Dotfiles Tool Configuration
#
# This file is automatically created by `dotfiles setup` and saved to ~/.dotfiles.conf
# You can edit this file manually to change your dotfiles configuration.
#
# After making changes, run `dotfiles doctor` to verify everything still works.

# Path to your dotfiles repository
# This is where your configuration files are stored
dotfiles_dir = "/Users/yourusername/dotfiles"

# XDG Base Directory for config files
# Most modern tools store their config here
xdg_config_home = "/Users/yourusername/.config"

# Language version manager to use
# Options: "Asdf", "Mise", "Rtx"
#
# - Asdf: Original, widely supported
# - Mise: Modern, faster alternative to asdf
# - Rtx: Older name for mise
language_manager = "Asdf"

# Symlink method for creating dotfile links
# Options: "Stow", "Manual"
#
# - Stow: Uses GNU Stow (recommended, more robust)
# - Manual: Creates symlinks directly (fallback if stow unavailable)
symlink_method = "Stow"

# Whether to install Oh My Zsh during setup
# Set to true if you want oh-my-zsh installed automatically

# Example configuration for different setups:
#
# macOS with mise:
#   dotfiles_dir = "/Users/yourusername/dotfiles"
#   xdg_config_home = "/Users/yourusername/.config"
#   language_manager = "Mise"
#   symlink_method = "Stow"
#   install_oh_my_zsh = false
#
# Linux with ASDF:
#   dotfiles_dir = "/home/yourusername/dotfiles"
#   xdg_config_home = "/home/yourusername/.config"
#   language_manager = "Asdf"
#   symlink_method = "Stow"
#   install_oh_my_zsh = true
